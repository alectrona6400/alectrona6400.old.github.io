	  <p>Ah yes, my problematic coping mechanism!</p>
	  <h2>Why do you like computers so much?</h2>
	  <p>I've probably got that from my dad who liked working on electronics and taking them apart. I'm very similar to him to the point where I should've been named *insert dad's name here* II. My dad took his new green machine bigwheel apart when he was around the age I got my own computer to access the internet with! One of the first computers I vividly remember taking apart was a dead Toshiba Satellite from 1997, and I was about 7 years old at the time.</p>
	  <p>I've always liked computers my whole life, and my plans for the future changed throughout my childhood (4-17y/o). Part of it may have been that earlier on in my childhood, I witnessed replacements of a lot of old computers. I wanted to have those old computers as my own, but they needed to be sent back to the school district (elementary) or I was simply not allowed to mess around with them (home). Also, no one <i>knew</i> that I even liked old computers and such until I was like, 9. I probably missed out on a good amount of stuff back then, but now I don't really care.</p>
	  <p>As I got older, I still wanted to pursue my hobbies and even a future career with computer repair. I didn't have my own computer (that was usable) until I was 8. I didn't have my own desktop until I was 11, and I didn't use custom parts to build a computer until I was 12. I didn't know how to solder until I was 15, and I got a (cheap) hot air station at 16. Approaching my 20s in a couple of years, I hope to pursue in BGA repairs, but more importantly, I want to pursue in Computer Systems Design and Engineering. I've also gained an interest with security evaluations and networking. I've also learned about multimedia and how I can work with programs to make videos, or even use HTML to write a website like this!* Long story short, it went from playing Thinkin' Things Collection 2 on an eMac** to evaluating computers in a multitude of ways.</p>
	  <p style="font-size:60%">*-Admittedly, I used a web template from 2002 as a base to write this website. I don't remember where it came from, but I found it on an old hard drive along with dozens of other templates. I didn't want to write something that looked too archaic, but I also didn't want to use JS and HTML5.</p>
	  <p style="font-size:60%">**-I tried running it on similar machines, yet it ran <i>way too fast.</i> I'm not sure what my school got, but it must have been a revised version that added a speed cap.</p>
	  <h2>How do you have all this?</h2>
	  <p>It's complicated.</p>
	  <p>Mostly I got them passed down from family, from listings on eBay, peripherals from yard sales, school surplus sets, and from unexpected roadside finds. In the past year or 2, I also simply asked people (obviously when appropriate) if they had anything, and a good amount of stuff came from them too. Where I live, there aren't any notable recycling centers other than my city dump, which isn't a safe place... more on that later. I got very good use out of the ones I had initially, but I had the impulse to start collecting various systems which didn't always work. I recommend finding a non-government-run recycling center and asking them if they have anything you can pick up; most of the time, city dumps just hate you. Also, check your local auction sites! They could have something you're interested in <b>for dirt cheap.</b> You can also talk to your teachers from schools you went to and see if they have anything. I've personally made great friends with my middle school STC, who has given me a number of old business laptops, monitors, and desktops.</p>
	  <p>There was a massive influx of computers during late 2019 and early 2020, because I managed to get myself to the city dump. That turned out to backfire a couple of years later, but more on that later. I found a good amount of stuff from that place, and some of these things are still in use today! However, it was also a source of parts to fix my computers, and a source of a lot of failed builds. The problem? I live in a city where a metro is located. Said metro is quite a high-crime place at that. Turns out, the city dump was located in said metro as well. I usually went when they were closed, so no one was there. And when no one's there... someone could be. On March 20, 2022, my bike got stolen after I picked up a set of laptops not-so-destined for the scrapper; I locked it, and this diabolical person <b>cut my lock off when I wasn't present.</b>. Not to mention, <b>I did not realize a corrections center was literally next door to that place!</b> It'll suck that I can't go there without the potential risk of being taken advantage of, but in the long run it'll encourage me to be more aware of my surroundings when finding salvage electronics. Long story short, the city dump is now <b>a no-go.</b></p>
	  <h2>What I own</h2>
	  <p>Too much if you don't want to read what's below.</p>
	  <p>Computers marked in <b>bold</b> are ones more prominent to me. I also just didn't bother for the rest.</p>
	  <p style="font-size:60%">People who knew me for <strike>too long</strike> reading this list: You might recollect something I may have had. This list took me hours to write, merely because I don't remember well of almost half of the computers I got. I'll definitely have missed at least one or two systems.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Do I have a problem? Yes. Am I working on it? Going to. The massive influxes are probably worth something on some stupid reality TV show, but fuck em. As I'm writing this, I'm tasked to gather stuff to haul to the scrapyard. Hopefully that'll make space for what's to come and what's to stay.</p>
<p>Having to use a counter function on w3's website, I have had <b>180</b> computers throughout the course of my life! I don't feel like counting the ones I have now, but I'm sure it's a third of that anyway. Honestly, it's nothing to brag about; I just knew where to go. I have definitely missed some, but I don't really care anyway. <b>Please, don't let this inspire you. I just felt stupid.</b></p>
