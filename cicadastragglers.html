      <h1>Brood X isn't JUST over yet, as a miniscule number will emerge in 2022</h1>
      <p>Written 5/18/2022, last updated N/A</p>
	  <h2>"What even is Brood X?"</h2>
	  <p>Brood X is a... well, brood of 17-year cicadas that is the largest and occurs in a good amount of the northeastern US. The last 3 emergences were in 2021, 2004, and 1987. They will emerge again in 2038, 2055, 2072, and so on. However, like all things in nature, nothing is perfect; there are off-cycle emergences that can happen 1-4 years early or late. For example, Brood X was seen in large amounts in 2004, yet stragglers appeared in 2000, 2003, 2005, and 2008 (in which this year was also when Brood XIV emerged, in which stragglers of that brood would have popped up in 2004 for the most part). The 4 year early cycles are somewhat common, as with some 1 year cycles. The late 1 year or 4 year cycles, especially the latter, are rare. Keep in mind, these are not 13-year cicadas! They are the same 17-year species that wreaks havoc during the early summer.</p> 
	  <p>I live in northern Kentucky, so we got quite a lot back in 2021. I remember riding my bike down some of the parks, and I probably wore myself out by then. They popped up all around me, and I couldn't go a day without them begging for a mate! As much as I hated it after a while, I can't help but notice this phenomenal event that takes place a few times in one's lifetime. However, we're in a world that is CONSTANTLY moving, and they become quite a pain in the ass to deal with. In a nutshell, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViXSzU8UjbI"><b>their whole motive is this.</b></a></p>
	  <h2>"Where do I find these little bastards off cycle?"</h2>
	  <p>If you know an area that DEFINITELY had these before, check the trees and find holes or cicada shells. You might also see a good example of the molting cycle, like I did! It takes a bit of looking in a less dense area, but you'll probably see at least one.</p>

	  <p>Apologies for the sucky camera focus, this also served as me using a Kodak Z710 camera from 2006 just to see how it'd look. My hands were a bit shaky because I had a heavy backpack on, which I should have taken off. Oh well, it should be easy to tell what you see.</p>
	  <p>But yeah, these little fuckers aren't done JUST YET. Well, 99% of them are at least. I remember seeing a Dimension 3000 on the curb once, and these bastards were ALL OVER IT on one side. Needless to say I just left it there, plus it's a Dell Dimension 3000... what are you going to do with such a barren XP machine?</p>
