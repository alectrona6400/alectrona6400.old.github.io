	  <h2>My interest in Computers and Technology</h2>
	  <p>Computers & Technology, Gaming, Cars, Repair, Engineering, Anime, Exploration.</p>
	  <p>My interest in technology is quite a vast one. I've used computers from decades ago and the ones we use now. It's no doubt that I've studied a good amount of these machines as far back as 2009 and 2010! The more prominent computers I used were in school, the Apple eMac and the HP Compaq dc5800MT. Teachers were using HP Compaq 2710p and tc4400 laptops, the former of which I have a model of and am typing on right now! (I have both, but the 2710p is currently active at the moment)</p>
	  <p>It wasn't long until I started taking more of an interest in computer hardware. One of the first computers I took apart was an old Toshiba Satellite laptop from the mid 1990s... I can't remember what the model was but it had a mobile Pentium MMX processor with Windows 95. While it turned on, the screen didn't light up. I didn't know why, so I went with my dad and my brother to the living room table and we took it apart. Obviously later on I'd know this was done in a sort of unconventional way, but back then those were... worthless. Now, those fetch a pretty penny on a site like eBay, and I have no fucking clue why. These are not antiques from the 1800s, they are old computers from the 90s that almost EVERYONE had.</p>
	  <p>That sole moment pretty much started my fascination with taking apart computers, old and new. Now I've factored in some other things I could learn, like how the design could have been improved and how similarities in certain computers apply to a multitude of others. For example, while the G3 iMacs were very popular and had a great look to them (for the time... and not for some), they weren't the best with internal designs. The later ones had notable issues with internal frames cracking to dust and the CRT boards completely going out. My G3 iMac in particular is a 700MHz and the CRT is about to die. <b>If you were to design something, please look for potential faults and test EXTENSIVELY!</b> There will be dire consequences if not, trust me.</p>
	  <p>I've worked on hundreds of computers in the past and I've owned dozens of them over the years. The things you find when working on a diverse selection of computers will be nothing short of vast. Either an overbored engineer snuck a message etched onto a motherboard (like with the Switch Pro controller), or someone was just overconfident that their "beefy" cooling system wouldn't have to spin up all the time. While the former could be a neat little wholesome message, the latter is just overconfident that something won't work. (EXAMPLE: Pretty much every Pentium 4 laptop....)</p>
	  <p>It's safe to say I have a vast amount of experience covering a wide range of computers and other technology. I might not be the best with things like, new computers and their cooling systems and designs, but that's because I don't usually have access to certain hardware. I've only had 1 or 2 things from the 1980s, and maybe something as far back as the 70s. However, I never really got to fix them or keep them for long.</p>
	  <h2>My interest in games and consoles</h2>
	  <p>I'll be honest, games and television/movies isn't something I take on very often. However, I do work on the electronics behind that, and I also have played a good amount of games myself. I grew up with the Nintendo 64, Wii, and PS2 up until my adolescence. By that point I just started working on computers and other hardware, and also started working on game consoles. I will say, trying to find certain parts or games for these won't be cheap! I usually softmod my consoles when possible, but I have a good set of cartridge games for some consoles like the N64 and the SNES. Disc games on the other hand? Forget about em if possible. Cartridge games are also starting to fail, but they were meant to last. Discs on the other hand, they don't hold up so well if kept in dire conditions. I'd also like to mention that your disc drives will start failing; my childhood Wii still works yet has this problem.</p>
	  <p>As for actually playing games, I've played driving sims like Gran Turismo and a good amount of Nintendo games. One of my all time favorites is Super Mario 64, as I've taken a good perspective on that game. When I was a kid, I had a lot of old stuff just... around, because my parents grew up in the 80s and 90s, and I was born 4 years after my older brother was. We had a good amount of time to get our technology needs set by then... so I'm one of those kids who just managed to cross some form of a generational gap. Super Mario 64 was very fascinating to me as a kid, the fact that you could travel through worlds in a 3-Dimensional space. Now this wouldn't be too important in a year like 2008 or 2009, but for me who's played Treasure Galaxy on a school eMac, it was quite an experience. Hell, I even grew up to like the controller. Look, I know it's not good, but it was one of the first controllers I've ever used, so cut me some slack. :)</p>
	  <p>Looking back as I'm approaching my 20s, it was fun to discover the many games on the computers and game systems I used back in the day. I played a wide variety of edutainment titles from the early 2000s and mid-late 1990s along with Nintendo 64 and Wii games, even Vizzed emulation when that was still a thing. I know a good amount of people my age who had a similar setup, and I know people my age who just fake it remembering a lot of old mid 2000s commercials while being a mere fetus.</p>
	  <p>Anyways, back to games... I honestly don't play too much of them anymore. Mainly that's because I'm at a point in my life where I need to really get my shit together, or I've just never had time for it. I did fix up an SNES lately and I've had a good time playing 2-player Kirby's Dream Land 3 with my brother as of this writing; we started World 2 yesterday.</p>
	  <h2>My interest in Exploration</h2>
	  <p>Back in January 2006 when I was halfway from turning 2 years old, I ran off into the street from the house. The result? My mother ran to save me and we put up a gate. That gate is very much still alive and well. Obviously in the past 16 years, things did change significantly. I'm an adult now, I've got a driver's permit, soon to be licensed in some way. I rode a bike for a long time, which recently got stolen. I took a walk or 2 in my life, probably way more than just 1 or 2 depending on how I'd remember it.</p>
	  <p>From going to the stop sign at the end of the street and back to going 20mi away from home, my interest in cycling was a very packed one at that. Recently as I've been getting older, I've been able to drive (on a condition, because permits amirite). I took an interest in cars to some extent and I looked up all sorts of inner workings. I found some faults with certain cars (like the newer Mitsubishi Mirage not having a steering lock...) and I've identified some certified <b>bangers</b> of cars, like the 2001 V6 Camry XLE. That's a great first car and I'd totally want that!</p>
	  <p>Cycling has honestly kinda dwindled for me as I've started becoming older. It's a great way to get some exercise, but everyone's driving now. It would be nice to have a bike to commute around small parts of town, but my family has plans for me to get a car someday... at least until they get the insurance unfucked because I'm a young legal male, and my older brother wrecked his car. <strike>Perhaps if you take Jeremy Clarkson's advice to slice your penis off, you might get significantly better insurance rates.</strike></p>
	  <p>I've been to many places; the city parks, the city dump (to find computers, and now it's super shady), and the roads+suburbs. I think I've been around a good part of the district. Unfortunately, as my bike got stolen, this hasn't really happened often other than well, my grandmother taking me out to drive (I NEED A LICENSE!!) whenever POSSIBLE... and just going places if needed. I'm about to graduate High School, and the things on my to-do list is overfilling a massive mental bucket.</p>
	  <h2>My interest in Japanese Arts+Culture and Anime</h2>
	  <p>Yes, I do like this stuff. Well, at least whatever makes sense; <strike>the japanese are weird most of the time.</strike> My first introduction to this type of stuff was probably some of the things I saw in Nintendo games, like certain characters in Smash 4 (yes, we were one of those families CONFIDENT in the Wii U...) and someone on Skype who went by the name "Ayami Ooruri", which returned an Anime character from an obscure idol series known as Pretty Rhythm. Yes, I was one of those people... I thought she was cute and set pictures of her as my wallpaper and my avatar, while not knowing jack about PR. I was like this for a good few years on end, varying in characters and franchises. I don't remember too much of my early Internet presences, but they were nothing short of ODD. I had these characters and such plastered on my computer screenshots and profiles, yet knew nothing significant about them. A lot of people are like that, too... and I was absolutely one of them. That's not so much of a bad thing per se, but it's ultimately baseless as to what you're putting on your profile.</p>
	  <p>One of the first anime series I watched in full was Yuyushiki. It was a slice of life anime that didn't seem to have a plot, but I liked it quite a bit. The dynamic of "I like these 2 friends I have, but they are nothing short of annoying" was quite well executed, too. I'll be honest, I haven't watched an entire anime in full other than that, but I am working on finishing Symphogear (which is getting to the last episode of XV). I did try to do such a few times, but ultimately I just ended up watching 1 or 2 episodes of a series and just stopping there. The plot advancements in an anime like Senki Zesshou Symphogear season 1 kept me going, somehow. Probably because I had too much leisure time during spring break recently?</p>
	  <p>And yes, I'm more than aware of the aversions to things like Anime and Manga... and I have a page which has some details on that. Basically, a good amount of anime you see has a perverted teenager or 2 trying to gain as many hearts as he could (harems... amirite) and that's sometimes the first thing that comes to mind. There are some diamonds in the rough, and if you know where to look, something could fit you. However, most people just fixate on that thought, when in reality they could just be watching softcore porn. There ARE people who enjoy that stuff, and for a short amount of time I was... unfortunately one of those people. Again, merely personal opinions and experience here... not fact! However, it could be something to keep in mind; not all animes are harems... but unfortunately a good amount of them are!</p>
	  <h2>Basic electronics, mechanics, and engineering</h2>
	  <p>This is what I plan to study in the future! Seeing as how I've identified a good amount of potential oversights in some popular computers, I feel like this could be a good way to go for a career. I've reverse engineered some very simple circuits, like the power buttons/LED board on an old Dell Dimension XPS tower from the late 90s (and I wish I kept that.) I've retraced a broken SNES controller+LED board (2 layers!!), and I have fixed NUMEROUS computers with the sheer power of a crappy soldering iron I bought off eBay.</p>
	  <p>As for mechanical things, I've fixed a fair amount of mechanical issues. Recently I fixed my grandfather's watch turner, which used a belt (like the one you'd find in an old CD-ROM drive!) and that was honestly more simple. However, I've taken this basic knowledge to a level to where I can easily fix something if I see fit. <i>There's a long-neglected Toyota MR2 in my neighborhood... if only I could <b>just FUCKING FIX THAT.</b></i></p>
	  <p>Engineering is something I'm still considering whether or not I have vast knowledge on. While I have managed to reverse-engineer some obviously simple circuits, something else like an old 80s computer motherboard would be a much more daunting task. I've had quite a lot of ideas, though! Recently I thought of maybe adapting the LC III internals into a Macintosh Classic, but that kinda fell under the radar now. I'm considering a career in Computer Systems Design and Engineering, though. That should be a perfect fit for me, and I can still repair stuff if I want to. I'll just be taking bigger tasks on too. ;)</p>
	  <h2>List of things I have experience with in particular</h2>
	  -Simply using a computer<br>
	  -Repairing Apple eMacs, 2003-05 models to <b>analog board level.</b><br>
	  -Overclocking various PowerPC macs, using data from old forums and now-defunct blogs<br>
	  -Setting up various different Windows versions, mostly from 98SE to Windows 11<br>
	  -Setting up legacy Macintosh computers and modern Mac systems<br>
	  -Replacing capacitors frantically... surface mount and through-hole<br>
	  -Rewiring a power connector to fit another standard type, such as ATX to G3/Early G4<br>
	  -Soldering and hot-air repairs whenever needed<br>
	  -Finding bad components with a multimeter<br>
	  -Identifying bad components solely from looks<br>
	  -Repairing power supplies with faulty capacitors<br>
	  -Swapping monochrome CRTs, notably in compact macs after I broke one on accident<br>
	  -Using a multimeter to help adjust POTs to fix an optical disc laser<br>
	  -Setting up a near-useless 32-bit PelicanHPC cluster with crappy HP laptops<br>
	  -Swapping LCD panels between laptops and sometimes even monitors<br>
	  -Working with Linux command line systems<br>
	  -Setting up legacy systems for use with specialized hardware<br>
	  -Setting up Xenserver... somewhat<br>
	  -Setting up a wireless network<br>
	  I'm pretty sure you get the idea now, so I'll shut up.
	  <p>As for general life experience, that's something I don't have to go into detail with. I was going to write it here, but I'm better off just... not doing that at all. Just think twice before you do something.</p>
