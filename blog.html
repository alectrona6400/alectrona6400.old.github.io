        <h2>Welp. It's been a while.</h2>
        <p>I got a few computers, one of which runs Windows ME surprisingly.. fine. It's a complete HP tower set from 2000 given out by ford motor company via PeoplePC or whatever... I can't think well today, more on that later. I also bought myself a new laptop and even a couple of old iMacs just for the hell of it.</p>
		<p>The bad news? I knocked off a fan blade while dusting out my computer. It's loud as hell. The good news about this is that I finally have a good case I can swap the whole system into, an old server tower enclosure. I never particularly liked my Musetex case for many reasons, the main one being that it has no optical bays. Also, RGB is overrated. I like my systems professional.</p>

        <h2>Wanted: Macintosh Performa/Power Macintosh 5xxx DEAD OR ALIVE</h2>
        <p>Hello. I usually don't do this, but I have been looking for an old Macintosh Performa 5000 series computer, dead or alive. I also take parts for them. If you have one that you are willing to ship CAREFULLY, HEAVY SIDE DOWN, or know someone who may have one, please contact me via email. Could also do a local (preferred, shipping is risky) deal given that you are in a 120-mile radius from Jefferson County/Bullitt County, KY.</p>

        <h2>A new and improved website, at last!</h2>
        <p>It's about time I made this site better. Yes, I am sure most people will complain to me that it doesn't run on IE4 or whatever, but this HAD to be done. Also, fancy blog format. I didn't write this site entirely by myself, but I did want to make a site closer to what I would have initially envisioned.</p>

        <h2>Regarding Twitter</h2>
        <p>I am considering ditching Twitter in favor of simply using smaller platforms that won't induce so much anxiety. The site is nothing short of a cesspool, and I've always felt that my presence should have been smaller to start with. I've made the account private, so it will only be accessible to people I follow. I am uncertain on when I will make another public account, but it is unlikely.</p>
		<p>I am starting college classes tomorrow. I am also doing this because of someone spreading hate and encouraging hate to me because of my identity. If you think it's okay to do that, <b>consider getting a life.</b> Oh well... twitter is a total cesspool.</p>

        <h2>I guess I'm an adult now.</h2>
        <p>Guess I haven't talked here in a while. Why? I graduated High school and I have also been preparing for college. Let me tell you... I barely get a chance to update this stuff. Hell, most of my motivation to update the site came from me using my old laptops and such throughout school to write this damn thing simply because I had free time and they were not exactly powerful for more fun stuff. That computers page alone took me HOURS to write... and usually I feel demotivated and/or simply fucken tired because that's just how my brain works.</p>

		<p>Anyway... I have been getting back into old iOS devices simply because I have a lot of them, some of which are locked because Apple automatically enables Find My iPhone... yuck! Some of my favorite devices are my white 64GB iPad 2 and white 64GB 4S, but my most favorite is my white 32GB iPhone 4 with blobs for 4.3.5, 5.0.1, and 5.1.1! I also have a gold 64GB iPhone 5S that still runs iOS 8.2, which unfortunately suffers from a baseband bug. Wish I could update that baseband once the right exploits are found, which may take YEARS... that thing flies and honestly it would make a great backup device if location services were fully functional.</p>
		<p>Hopefully all is well with the people visiting my site. This year has been a fucking roller coaster thus far.</p>

	  this website is best displayed on internet explorer 6.0 with service pack 2 or later, however you shouldn't be using ie6.<br>
	  minimum ideal screen resolution is 800x600. that wasn't easy to make it work well, either.</div>
