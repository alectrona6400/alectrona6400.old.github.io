      <p>I have just managed to find a copy of the Sony VAIO PCG-K47 BIOS (R0108X3) which has ended up working flawlessly on my long-neglected PCG-K23. The newer BIOS supports Prescott Pentium 4 CPUs which brings a much wider array of application and OS options for these laptops. It's obviously not much now, but these are arguably the last nice VAIOs sony built, despite their choice of processor. My K23 has grown on me quite a bit and having it with a much faster processor is a welcome change. I keep forgetting I am running this computer on nearly a gig of RAM... it's still bearable now with the right set of tools!<p>

	  <p>I am working on doing a slight redesign for the website. I'm keeping the style yet I am making it more colorful!</p>

      <p>Been inactive for a while! I got a good influx of computers in and I will probably do a writeup on my top items that I own as a whole. Also, merry christmas to all of you. Hopefully in 2022 we won't see the word "hell" become offensive.</p>

      <p>God, I have not touched this in a while. My macbooks that I used for writing the site started to have some issues. Also, thinking of moving the domain to Neocities or Geocities.ws</p>

      <h2>The Magic Mouse SUCKS!</h2>
      <p>I mean, the actual mouse is okay, but the battery contacts? PURE GARBAGE. Yes, I know Apple put out a Magic Mouse 2 like, 6 years ago... but the original one still remains in good use by many. I use a PowerBook G4 to write this site, and the trackpad isn't sufficient. Yes, I know, it was what we had in 2005 unless you bought the wrong laptop that gave you a BIOS error once you upgraded the hard drive. I used the magic mouse for a while and the words "Connection Lost" with the MM icon have been engraved into my brain ever since. The battery contacts in the original Magic Mouse are somewhat... insufficient at providing good contact. Maybe if Apple used a spring like everyone else did along with a convex positive terminal, this issue would have been avoided. Those are tried and true battery terminal styles and provide GREAT contact. We're not stupid enough to bend the spring... or at least, most of us aren't. I swear, most of Apple's products are overdesigned... and a little underdesigned. Put an eMac and an iMac G3 side by side... the eMac is far more robust in its build quality while the iMac G3 can't hold its own weight. The magic mouse is working as of this writing, but I swear it'll lose connection again due to the shitty battery contacts Apple put upon that thing. As for the MM2, I actually have several of those, but it's just like a slimmer Pro Mouse when you connect it to an older Mac.</p>

      <p>Using a PowerBook G4 to write further updates to the site at the moment. Still works great even in a day and age where idiotic JS writers make the biggest websites on the internet!</p>

      <p>MacBook's HDD just died a slow and painful death. Knew I should have put an SSD in...</p>
      <h4>November 8th, 2021 7:41AM</h4>
      <p>Just put in a placeholder for the files page. Will post things on there soon, but not sure right now. Plus, I managed to put error pages in.</p>
      <h4>November 7th, 2021 6:00PM</h4>
      <p>Have a G3 PDQ that's pretty damn broken. Why do the damn chargers cost a fortune??</p>
      <h4>November 6th, 2021 3:31PM</h4>
      <p>I need a better bike.</p>
      <h4>November 5th, 2021 2:09PM</h4>
      <p>I am writing this during some sort of cheering event at school and I am the only one here in the classroom still. Just need to keep working on the site...</p>
