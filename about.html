      <h1>Need an introduction?</h1>
      <p>I am Nick, usually known as k24a1 online. I'm a 17 (1/2) year old person who has a variety of different interests! Said interests include working on computers both old and new, older video game consoles, general gaming, cycling, nature, cars, and the odds and ends around town.</p>
      <p>I am studying Security Fundamentals at my high school and have worked on Networking and Computer Hardware/Software Maintenance in past years. A lot of experience I have, however, is self-taught. When I was younger, I would go on YouTube quite often; aside from the golden meme videos from the past decade and a half that I watched (and got told on for), I watched videos of people building, repairing, and showing off their old technology. One of my neighbors also hooked me up with some old info books about computers and operating systems from years past. (He died in January 2020. May you rest in peace.) I looked through a good amount of this information and was fascinated on how technology, especially older computers, came together to what we use today. Now, I work on various computers of different eras; it's great to have experience with hardware from different timelines as <i>you never know what'll run into you.</i></p>
	<p>As a technician, I am pro-Right to Repair. Most of the time, I fix older computers to resell them and give them new life, <strike>unless someone like Plainrock124 ends up buying it and decides to capitalize on their YouTube "career" by destroying it</strike>. Speaking of capitalism, pretty much every manufacturer takes advantage of it by locking down their components. For example, Apple iPhones can only have certain parts replaced in them if you bring it in to an Apple Store and pay a big sum of money just to have your battery or screen replaced. And this isn't exactly a new thing, either. Companies have been locking down parts, mostly to ensure that you have an OEM spec part. As aftermarket parts are improving and as OEM parts become more readily available for the end user to install, it should be a good idea to allow yourself to fix it.</p>
	<p>Honestly, there's not much else I can put here without oversharing. I'm just a guy who works on various pieces of old technology, and finds new life for them. However, I do have some computer-related opinions:</p>
	   Last good IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad? - T400 if we're talking rigidity and reliability. Anything after the T400 feels cheaper, but the newer ThinkPads are awfully promising. Personally, I'm more of a fan of the Dell Latitude systems.<br>
	   Windows, Mac, or Linux? - All 3. I'd main a Linux OS had the support been WORKABLE. Yes, proton, wine, and other frontends (is that the right term?) exist, but they still have a long way to go before they reach the accuracy that Windows has, especially as a closed-source operating system.<br>
	   Intel or AMD? - Depends on which generation. Not exactly sure about the late 90s, but Intel took the crown in some regards, aside from L2 cache. If we're talking the early-mid 2000s, I would go with AMD any day; the Pentium 4 was an architectural <b>disaster.</b> I'd take a Core 2 Quad over a Phenom X4, and a Phenom II X4/X6 over later Core 2 Quads. AMD FX we can just forget about, because we have the 3770K. AMD Ryzen is the way to go nowadays...<br>
	    Were Vista and ME okay? - Vista <i>SP2</i>, yes. ME, no.<br>
	    Which laptop brands do you like? - HP and Dell. In some cases, IBM.<br>
	    68k, PowerPC, Intel, or ARM? - You're taking a generational scope to me, brother. In my opinion, PowerPC feels like the more modern architecture. 68K isn't even being developed further, and ARM is becoming more like a CISC architecture. RISC and big endian should have been the way forward, if I'm honest. However, PowerPC had some issues with scalability and heat output, but that could also be the fact that the processors were a bit outdated when they got into macs.<br>
	    <p>That's all I have to share for now. Hopefully you'll enjoy interacting with me and reading through this website if you'd like!</p>
