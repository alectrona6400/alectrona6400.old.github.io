<h2>About me</h2>
<p class="intro">Hello! As you can probably tell I'm k24a1 (not the honda engine). People call me Kat or even k24 sometimes. I'm a nonbinary person diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. I have taken on a lot of interests; Said interests include working on computers both old and new, older video game consoles, mobile devices, cycling, nature, cars, and the odds and ends around town.</p>
<p>I am working to pursue in Computer Science and Engineering for a career considering how far my hobbies have taken me. Throughout the years, I have worked on many pieces of tech, mostly computers and mobile devices. A lot of experience I have, however, is self-taught. When I was younger, I would go on YouTube quite often; aside from the golden meme videos from the past decade and a half that I watched (and got told on for), I watched videos of people building, repairing, and showing off their old technology. One of my neighbors also hooked me up with some old info books about computers and operating systems from years past. (He died in January 2020. May you rest in peace.) I looked through a good amount of this information and was fascinated on how technology, especially older computers, came together to what we use today. Now, I work on various computers of different eras; it's great to have experience with hardware from different timelines as <i>you never know what'll run into you.</i></p>
<h2>Why "k24a1"?</h2>
<p>A year or 2 after I chose that username, I'm asking the same question. However, there is a reason behind it.</p>
<p>Before this, I went by "kurumitokisaki4400" for a couple months. I never really got a chance to indulge myself in Date A Live (besides, it's a harem) so I ended up ditching that. I initially chose my new (at the time) username because I was <i>very</i> interested in looking at cars at age 16 (namely Honda/Toyota). I remember my grandmother driving a 2006 Honda CR-V (which used the K24A1 engine), and I'd go to her house when I was little to calm down and take a break from whatever troubled me at home. Given that I was in a tough spot at this point (July-October 2020), I decided to give myself a username, that being k24a1. This represented a new era for me, one where I would re-think how I would go online and communicate. I've been on the internet before, but I decided to restart my presence due to security complications. People think I'm a honda enthusiast because of my username, and now I'll just refer them to this page to clear up this misconception. Unfortunately, that car got totaled on April 5, 2021, which inspired me to keep this username in memory of such a great car that we relied on for 15 years. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to drive that car but I have plenty of great memories riding in that car. I also don't feel like changing my username because I don't want to confuse anyone now.</p>
