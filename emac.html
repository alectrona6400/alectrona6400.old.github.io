      <h1>eMac Projects</h1>
      <p>It goes without saying that the eMac is one of the more "iconic" computers that Apple has made. Every classroom in existence had them (well, the ones that weren't sweltering hot... thanks Intel.) and consumers usually chose them over the iMac G4 due to cost and a better focus <strike>for people like me who keep fidgeting with the iMac's screen.</strike></p>
      <h2>My eFleet</h2>
      <p>First, we have the one and only 1.92GHz 2005 eMac. This is a 1.42GHz unit overclocked to 1.92GHz with 2GB of DDR-400 memory and a 256GB modified mSATA SSD. This computer has been running rock solid for over a year and runs great on even stock 10.5.8. This used to be an ATI graphics eMac, and later a USB 2.0 eMac. At some point, I managed to find a "Q86J" motherboard from salvage and I knew what to do next. Hopefully this won't fuck up and I won't have to do another heart transplant.</p>
      <p>Next, we have 2 eMacs that were from my high school. An early production USB 2.0 model and a 1GHz ATI graphics model. A teacher who worked with macs over the years had these along with a QuickSilver 2002 and some install discs. I was given these items over the course of a week and managed to look at them. The USB 2.0 needed a tuneup, and I did find something interesting. This USB 2.0 is early production as I said. How would I know that, you may ask? This USB 2.0 eMac has an ORIGINAL PowerPC 7447 processor. No, not the 7447A or the 7447B, the original 7447 with all of its rough edges. I only managed to overclock this processor to 1.42GHz. <strike>You could sell this on eBay running Tiger and not having the system profiler open and people will immediately think it's a 2005 model.</strike> <b>Okay, don't actually do that.</b></p>
      <p>The ATI Graphics model had some issues on the other hand. I had to replace a good chunk of capacitors on the motherboard, which was kind of a cakewalk until one of the caps I DIDN'T replace started bulging. Also, my brain had some serious Taco Bell gas and had forgotten to do various things while putting it back together. It works great now, but I do plan to get the CPU overclocked. Not sure how that will turn out, but from what I have seen it's not too hard to overclock an ATI eMac. I know one board I had did not want to go to 1.33 reliably.</p>
      <h2>eMac eInfo</h2>
      <p>This is a section where I talk about information on the eMacs, such as known issues and workarounds.</p>
      <h3>Bad capacitors</h3>
      <p>If you have an ATI Graphics eMac or a USB 2.0 eMac (or in some rare cases, a 2005 model), chances are that if it's not working, the computer has bad capacitors. Unfortunately, this was common for 99% of computers made from 1999-2008; someone "added a small dose of Chemical X" to the electrolytic capacitor formula. There were chemical-level conflicts which had caused the capacitors to fail prematurely. I'm not going into too much detail, but if you are working on a computer from the early-mid noughties, that should give you an idea. Most cases the motherboard (some say Logic Board) has bad capacitors. In some cases, the CRT analog board ends up having bad capacitors, which can be a pain in the ass to repair. I'll do a writeup on how to service the Analog Board one day. Apple doesn't even WANT you to get that far; their service manual says to replace the WHOLE tube assembly which is <b>no longer available.</b> And in the case you ever break your CRT while doing anything, <b><i>you're fucked.</b></i></p>
      <p>9.9 times out of 10 you will find the ratings for the capacitors you need to replace. I will compose a set of diagrams someday.</p>
      <h3>"Honey, I turned my screen into a trapezoid!" (2002 eMac)</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, I've never used a 2002 eMac outside of my early elementary school years, so I am not of much help in this regard. Apple says you will need to replace the IVAD cable, which can be quite challenging. No one has found a workaround for that other than replacing the cable, but I am not going to skip this one. The issue is somewhat rare on the 2002 eMacs and I have not seen many of them online with raster shift. I have also seen pictures of 2003-05 eMacs suffering from raster shift, but I have never encountered that problem. If that is an issue, <b><i>it appears to be an extremely rare case on those models.</b></i>
      <h3>CRT replacement solutions</h3>
      <p>I have indeed worked on this before, as with a few other people. (Leo Bodnar, may your website rest in peace. Headless eMac mirror coming soon)</p>
      <h4>LCD-Mac</h4>
      <p>Yo dawg, I heard you're on a diet. So we put an LCD in yo eMac to make it lighter. This is for those who can't be arsed to fix their analog board or have a broken CRT. There are advantages and quite a good amount of disadvantages:</p>
      -You will need an ATX power supply, and that can only supply 12 volts at maximum. Some parts of your eMac may not work properly at that rate.<br>
      -You will need to modify your front bezel to get full viewability. This is VERY hard considering that you don't always know where that screen is going to be pinpointed. I have done this for a Hackintosh project, and boy do I regret my life choices by then.<br>
      -The IVAD-VGA connection that you would have to make would be somewhat unreliable. Also, you have no way to readily control brightness and contast unless you modify the case to control your monitor's board.<br>
      -A good amount of displays that can be hacked into the case would be 17 inch 1280x1024 panels with a CFL backlight. You will need a custom program to set your screen resolution. In the event that you do have another CRT to swap your board into, you will need to reset the PMU.<br>
      -The set of resolutions available on the eMac's ROM do not work with any LCD panel. Set all resolutions to run at 60Hz.<br>
      <p>So obviously, this can be done, but it's no easy feat. If you just need to boot the system up again, it may work. At that point you could always just use a mini-VGA to VGA adapter too...</p>
      <h4>Sacrifice another eMac</h4>
      <p>There are 2 ways you could go around this. Take the motherboard out of your old eMac and put it in the donor unit, or take the donor unit's CRT and put it into the other eMac. One method might work better for you depending on the condition of the computer. In the event the donor case is broken, you can swap the donor's CRT into your eMac. You can either repair the broken CRT assembly's analog board or you can scrap it for copper and aluminum. That works if you wanna get McDonald's money for something you don't need, and most of the time you wouldn't safely be able to package a bare eMac CRT assembly. Plus, by taking the metals to a scrapyard, you're recycling. People just pitch these or they get sent to Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do with the CRT anymore other than have fun and drop it off the roof to see it implode.</p>
      <h4>Headless eMac</h4>
      <p>I will take the liberty to mirror the now-defunct lbodnar webpage for this someday. Stay tuned.</p>
