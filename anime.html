      <p>"I don't watch much of it, but I have something to say about it." -k24a1, during this page's initial writing</p>
	  <p><b><i>Please note that some of the things I say on this page are satire (e.g. the list, or at least part of it), so please don't take it seriously. If you're fine with that, proceed. Just don't come crying to me saying the age of consent should be outlawed... pedophile.</b></i></p>
	  <p>Written 4/18/2022, last updated N/A</p>
	  <h2>Thoughts?</h2>
	  <p>Honestly, the Japanese do know how to really flesh out their works. I have notably seen some <b>wonderful</b> animation, character design, and character development in the Senki Zesshou Symphogear series. That's really the only anime I've ever invested my time into well enough. I've finished Season 1, G, and GX as of this writing, and am going through AXZ whenever I feel like watching an episode or 2.</p>
	  <p>As a whole, anime is unique compared to whatever we get in the west. I don't have much to say about western animation other than how great something like Smiling Friends is compared to other modern animated comedy. Plus, Nickelodeon is still using a 23-year-old sponge "to wash dishes" <b>that's way past its use cycle, and has been for 18 years.</b> Don't consider me a film/television critic (because I would be a horrible one), but I feel like we're always falling behind on something compared to the Japanese. That can be applied for many things... like car designing and engineering; GM is nothing compared to Toyota with how well they design their cars.</p>
	  <p>That being said, there are a good amount of people who don't like anime, and I can really see why. Most of the stuff you see is about a horny late-teenage man trying to gather as many girls as he can just to... have sex with, presumably. This is what is called <b>harem</b> anime, or as I call it, <b>hot garbage.</b> Don't get me wrong, there are harem animes/mangas in which their characters deserve much better, like Date A Live. To be honest, I have not watched the anime, but I have skimmed through the english translations of Volume 1 and 2. Basically this guy named Shido has to seal powers of a spirit (Tohka) by <b>locking lips with her.</b> Honestly, the romance part could be cute to some, but is there a less suggestive way you could pull that off...? Oh well, not like I'll invest more time into this series anyway. I've heard Kurumi's got some great character design, aside from the fact that <i>Date A Live is still a fucking harem.</i></p>
	  <p style="font-size: 60%">It's okay if you don't like something, but <b>please, for the love of god, don't try to bash someone for it.</b> I cannot count how many people who've turned away from me because I said that I liked anime.  Either it was an edgy high schooler who posts offensive memes with ear-piercing audio tracks, or it was someone who would've been enjoyable to talk with. This would probably fit the Experience page more, but ah well. Just... think twice and accept people for what they do or who they are... unless they're just too much of a douchebag. It's seemingly harder to find nice people these days, isn't it?</p>
	  <p>Japan in general has some weird stuff going on, too. I'm not particularly well versed in just how weird their stuff is, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bv19Aub3sA&t=275s">that doesn't mean it isn't particularly obvious.</a> But if you know what to watch and if you find something that'll fit you in at least <i>some</i> way, you could really enjoy it. I particularly liked the sci-fi and violence aspects of Symphogear, which somewhat resembles a more modern world and how combat would work... both realistically and non-realistically.</p>
	  <h2>Then... why do you bother?</h2>
	  <p>Because I had a lot of leisure time during Spring Break 2022 (which was the entire first week in April for me). I was cleaning up my area just a bit, then decided to get into Symphogear. Debating on whether or not I should have kept cleaning, but oh well. I knew a couple of people who've watched it, and suddenly it just came to mind.</p>
	  <p>Watching anime is something I normally don't do. However, I do look into small snippets and characters from time to time, which are some kind of a coping mechanism for me. I like the designs, I like the characters, and I like how I can relate to some of them, like Tsubasa Kazanari. Plus, I just get bored super easily.</p>
	  <h2>What have you watched?</h2>
	  <p>Not a lot. At all. However, I do remember the animes I've watched:</p>
	  -Azur Lane (watched Dec. 2019), dropped after 7 episodes<br>
	  -Lucky Star (watched a few episodes in Dec. 2018)<br>
	  -Nichijou (watched a few episodes in Jul. 2019)<br>
	  -Yuyushiki (watched May 2018, OVA watched ~2019)<br>
	  -Symphogear (finished)<br>
	  <p>Honestly, I don't have much time nor motivation to watch anime. But recently, Symphogear has been a fun watch!</p>
	  <p style="font-size: 60%">Rest in peace, Kanade. You deserved better.</p>
	  <h2>Communities</h2>
	  <p>This is where I start turning back when needed. Every anime community has the...</p>
	  -Person who doesn't know the age of consent. Fun fact: 911 is a number (you should be called on), not age.<br>
	  -Person who makes crappy memes. This is subjective, but there are a list of things I can name that have got old <b>fast.</b><br>
	  -<strike>Virgin.</strike><br>
	  -Dude with an animated Discord icon of a typical High School anime girl talking.<br>
	  <a href="http://k24a1.fleepy.tv">-The person who doesn't fit in.</a><br>
	  -The guy who runs the NSFW chat and probably commissioned half of it.<br>
	  -Harem bot.<br>
	  -Attention whore whose most active chat is the vent/serious chat. <b>Please, call a fucking doctor</b> if you have issues like this; Discord was not designed to be an online mental help platform. Individual discussions <i>with a psychologist</i> actually work, and I know someone who has benefitted from those substantially.<br>
	  -Guy who wants to play a gacha game yet has an eMMC+Celeron-powered laptop from Walmart.<br>
	  -Guy who spends his life savings to get a gacha character.<br>
	  -Typical Captain Fatass.<br>
	  -Person with an old Lenovo ThinkPad laptop that's as old as the characters they downloaded porn of, running Arch Linux or Gentoo Linux. Also has a crush on Richard Stallman.<br>
	  -PNG/Amateur Vtuber.<br>
	  -The one person with THIS ideology.<br>

	  <p>There are a sheer multitude of other things I can list, but this works. Pretty sure a good amount of it may just be my experiences and how I think of them in retrospect. It's nice to interact with those who know things about anime like you do, but you want to know where to go and what community would fit you best. Spoiler: It's damn hard.</p>
	    <h2>Why is pedophilia an issue in the anime community?</h2>
	    <p>This is a bit more of a serious topic, but I thought I would talk about this just so people could understand exactly what the fuck they're smoking. There's more to this than you might think, and boy is it terrifying.</p>
	    <p>First off, the scary thing... <b>the age of consent in Japan is only 13.</b> People get influenced by this like it's nobody's business, but many people (including me) see this as a corrupt problem. The ideal age of consent should be 18, no questions asked. As I was also listening to a prison psychologist on 4/29/22, pedophilia can also be traced to mental health. He's worked with many, many prisoners and has managed to bring the unruly back to the peaceful. There was one case he mentioned, where the mother of a family left for about 6 weeks, and the father of this family <b>had molested his 6-year-old daughter.</b> Then... it was off to the big house for him! I've observed that a good amount of people in anime communities seemingly have a similar issue that's tied to it, but mainly it's an issue of influencing <i>too</i> much from Japan.</p>
	    <p>Don't get me wrong, there are some cool things about Japan, but this is absolutely not one of them... there are more problematic things, but that's for another day.</p>
	  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	  <p>Arigatou Gozaimasu!</p>
	  <p style="font-size: 60%">fuck encoding.</p>
	  <p>If you've made it this far into the page, you deserve a raise. If you know what to watch, what to do, where to go, who to talk to, etc etc... you should be totally fine! However, that's just easier said than done, unfortunately. I've run into a number of communities myself which were full of the people I've just listed. It takes time and several joins and leaves to find the best place to stay. In conclusion, proceed with caution when engaging with communities, especially those related to anime... they have it the worst, unfortunately.</p>
	  <p>Once you have something that checks all the boxes and can talk with a community that fits you if needed, have fun!</p>
