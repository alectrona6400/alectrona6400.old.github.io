	  3-
	  <p>I cannot stress but recommend you to install <b>R0108X3</b> from my website. It works on the K-series VAIOs with the IGP 345M chipset, so pretty much every one of them. It irons out the many software issues these have, especially if you end up with the "Operating system not found" error on select models.</p>
      <h2>Maintenance level</h2>
      <p>Honestly, there isn't much to do from frequent maintenance of the cooling fans to dust them out, and to use high-quality thermal paste instead of the factory application. If you have upgraded your K-series with a Prescott CPU (requires R0108X3, testers wanted for other laptop models!!), you would definitely keep those in mind. The fans get <i>super</i> loud when you upgrade your processor to a Prescott CPU (ex. Mobile Pentium 4 538) and that is an indicator they are working harder to push cool air through the heatsink. It's not a general recommendation to install a Prescott CPU in a PCG-K33 or earlier, as the motherboards weren't exactly designed for it. I have installed a Prescott into my K23 and it works fine, but is missing some of the essential cooling.</p>
      <h2>Processor upgrades</h2>
      <p>You can install a Pentium 4 chip from the Northwood era, and the best one is the <b>Intel Pentium 4 2.8C without hyperthreading.</b> As for prescott CPUs, you can install <b>any Mobile Pentium 4 chip.</b></p>
	  <p>I would recommend the <b>Mobile Pentium 4 538</b> for a prescott chip. For northwoods (and for better temps and slightly quieter fans), the <b>Mobile Pentium 4 3.06C</b> is a good chip.</p>
      <h2>Storage, RAM, Power, and Wi-Fi</h2>
      <p>For a storage drive, I would recommend an <b>mSATA to 44-pin IDE adapter</b> with a <b>Samsung PM871 mSATA SSD of any capacity.</b></p>
	  <p>The max RAM for all K-series laptops is <b>1GB.</b> Some RAM is used for video memory because of the ATI Radeon IGP.</p>
	  <p>I recommend the <b>Mini-PCI Atheros AR5008 Wireless-N card.</b> There is no known whitelist on the K-series laptops.</p> 
	  <p>Find a <b>120W 19.5V Sony charger.</b> The batteries these laptops use have the P/N <b>PCGA-BP2NX.</b> However, you might want to steer clear of OEM batteries; <b>Sony cells were recalled in 2006.</b></p> 
      <h2>Operating system</h2>
	  <p>This isn't like the zd8000 where you could just run several generations of software. In hindsight with a prescott CPU, you could install Windows 8 or 8.1, but since the BIOS is so locked down with capabilities, <b>that may not work at all.</b> I would recommend installing <b>Windows 2000 or Windows XP.</b></p>
	  <p>There used to be a good amount of support for old Radeon 7000 cards on a GNU+Linux distribution, but unfortunately pretty much all modern kernels do not provide adequate support to run such an ancient framebuffer.</p>
	  <p>As for a hackintosh, there are old distros like <b>NO, NO, AND NO.</b></p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
	  <p>The Sony VAIO PCG-K series laptops have to be the more "to-the-point" Pentium 4 laptops of the era, but they weren't of much interest either. With okay processors and paltry graphics options, it did not attract most buyers. But for those who for some reason wanted a Pentium 4 laptop that was somewhat reliable, they usually opted for the VAIO. It's an interesting laptop in the sense that it was like an example of a more low-end Pentium 4 powered laptop. As we all know, these proof of concept systems that were made throughout the early-mid 2000s by various manufacturers ended in sheer disaster. Overheating, impracticality, bulkiness, and pretty much little to no market adoption. Apple could have done a PowerBook G5 with a much thicker body, but was it going to be something that most people would buy? Absolutely not. The Sony VAIO PCG-K series laptops have their place as some of the least interesting Pentium 4-based laptops of the time. As with most companies that made Pentium 4 laptops, they just gave up and moved on to the Pentium M and Intel Core series chips.... except for one company that wasn't "clevo" at the time about it.</p>
