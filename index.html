<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p class="intro">Hello, and thank you for stopping by! This is where I put most of the information I write about, along with projects, blerbs on the blog, etc etc...<br>
You may notice that the design of the website has changed, solely because A: It needed to. and B: It scales better on modern systems, while still working on a lot of older computers. Just note that you may want to install Firefox 2 if you're using something like Windows 98... I also felt like the site needed a mid-2000s look, which fits me better. Definitely feeling 2007 here... haha!</p>
<p>Navigation is as easy as the menu on top! Click one of the 6 buttons to explore different parts of the site!</p>
<h2>So, what is this site exactly about?</h2>
<p class="intro">Glad you asked! This is where I put most of the information about my projects, writeups about computers, and personal stories on my blog. I've come across as a good help resource with older computers and Macs. My writeups have helped at least a few people with certain machines and parts for them. I aim to provide good resources and information for computers both newer and older, and more niche systems too. Mainly, I work with x86 hardware, but I have also worked on PowerPC and 68k Apple computers. Yes, I know I may sound weak to the masses with the fact I haven't touched more <i>special</i> hardware, but hey... where are you going to find a cheap SGI workstation in this day and age?? I'd also like to mention most people do have contemporary PCs and Macs, so it's easy for me. I also do some research on old media center PCs, like HP Pavilions from the mid-2000s. Did I mention I am possibly an eMac aficionado?</p>

	  this website is best displayed on internet explorer 6.0 with service pack 2 or later, however you shouldn't be using ie6.<br>
	  minimum ideal screen resolution is 800x600. that wasn't easy to make it work well, either.</div>
