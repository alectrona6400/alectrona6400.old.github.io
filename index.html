<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p class="intro">Hello, and thank you for stopping by!</p>
<p>This is where I put most of the information about my projects, writeups about computers, and personal stories on my blog. I've come across as a good help resource with older computers and Macs. My writeups have helped at least a few people with certain machines and parts for them. I aim to provide good resources and information for computers both newer and older, and more niche systems too. Mainly, I work with x86 hardware, but I have also worked on PowerPC and 68k Apple computers. Yes, I know I may sound weak to the masses with the fact I haven't touched more <i>special</i> hardware, but hey... where are you going to find a cheap SGI workstation in this day and age?? I'd also like to mention most people do have contemporary PCs and Macs, so it's easy for me. I'd like to own some special hardware but personally it's not my forte.</p>
<p>Navigation is as easy as the menu on top! Click one of the 6 buttons to explore different parts of the site!</p>
